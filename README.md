# About

Come on, it's a placeholder for now, what did you expect?


# Make commands

`make build` builds the project from scratch 

`make run` builds and runs the project

`make clean` deletes everything from `dist\`

`make test` runs tests, lol as if I would write tests

`make dist` builds and outputs to `dist\`

# Running

Running the command `go run main.go` will create a webserver on port `8080`. You can access it by visiting `https://localhost:8080`
